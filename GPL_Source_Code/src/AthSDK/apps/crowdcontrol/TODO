TODO (from highest-priority down):
* Implement an SNMP broadcasting function in place of file-based logging.
* Possibly rewrite the URL-checking code in the same way the domain-checking
  code was, so it doesn't entirely rely on regular expressions and subsequently
  saves memory.
* Build separate GUIs for popular operating systems (Mac OS X and Windows XP);
  this will probably be done with wxWidgets under Xcode.
