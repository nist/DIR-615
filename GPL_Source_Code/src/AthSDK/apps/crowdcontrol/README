1.   Compiling Crowd Control

     a.   Under Linux     
          Run "make linux" at the command line.
          
     b.   Under SunOS     
          Run "make sunos" at the command line.
          
     c.   Under Windows     
          You can compile Crowd Control in Visual Studio .NET by creating a new
          blank command-line project and importing the source file. Under MinGW
          or Cygwin simply run "make unix".
          
     d.   Under Mac OS X, FreeBSD, and other generic UNIX clones     
          Run "make unix" at the command line. Under Mac OS X 10.4.2 or later,
          you can run "make linux" if you do not wish for TCP_BUFFER_SIZE to be
          modified (this isn't really recommended).

2.   Program Usage

     a.   Command line options     
          -p <port>
          --port <port>
          (default: 32800)          
          Have the proxy listen on port <port>.
          
          -a <ip>
          --bind <ip>
          (default: 127.0.0.1)          
          Bind to the Internet address <ip>. This can be a single IP (when the
          -s or --subnet options are not specified), or an entire subnet (when
          the subnet is specified). If neither -a nor -s are used, the proxy
          will only listen on the local socket (the most secure way to use it).
          
          -s <subnet>
          --subnet <subnet>
          (default: 255.255.255.255)          
          Specify the subnet (see notes above). It's recommended you give this
          a different value if you want more than one computer to use the
          proxy.
          
          --http-only
          --http-with-ssl
          --http-tunnel (default)          
          Specify what kinds of HTTP requests to permit. When using
          --http-only, only HTTP requests will be permitted. All HTTP CONNECT
          requests will be denied. When using --http-with-ssl, HTTP CONNECT
          requests will be permitted, but only to port 443 (https). When using
          --http-tunnel, all HTTP requests will be honored, no matter what port
          is used (even port 80).
          
          --implicitly-deny
          --implicitly-permit (default)          
          Specifiy the behavior of the access control module. When using
          --implicitly-deny, only URLs matching the whitelist will be
          permitted; no blacklist will be built. When using
          --implicitly-permit (the default), URLs matching the whitelist will
          be permitted, and URLs matching the blacklist will be denied. Any
          URLs not matching either list will be permitted.
          
          --permit-domains <file>
          --permit-urls <file>
          --permit-expressions <file>          
          Specify a file with a list of domains, URLs, or expressions to
          permit. The files must consist of one entry per line, with no spaces
          in any line whatsoever. Blank lines and comments (lines beginning
          with "#") are ignored. A line cannot contain a space (as URLs do not
          contain spaces); a space is considered to be the end of an entry!
          
          --deny-domains <file>
          --deny-urls <file>
          --deny-expressions <file>          
          Specify a file with a list of domains, URLs, or expressions to deny.
          See notes above.

          --test <URL>
          Test the filter using <URL>. You must leave off the "http://".
          
     b.   Using inetd (Linux/UNIX)
     
          Add this line in /etc/inetd.conf:          
          webcache stream tcp nowait nobody <path>/crowdcontrol crowdcontrol \
          (insert options here)

3.   Access Control List Syntax

     a.   Domain lists

          There are two types of domain entries. The first is the SquidGuard-
          like domain entry, where a domain may match exactly or may match the
          end of a domain.

          EXAMPLE: badsite.example.org

          This example will match "badsite.example.org" as well as any sub-
          domains behind it (such as "sub.badsite.example.org"), but not the
          parent domain ("example.org") or any other subdomain.

          The other type of domain entry only matches certain subdomains, no
          matter what the parent domain is. These entries are specified by a
          leading dot (".").

          EXAMPLE: badsite.

          This example will match "badsite.example.org", as well as any other
          domain that begins with "badsite" (such as "badsite.org").

     b.   URL lists

          A URL entry is meant to specify both a parent domain and a portion of
          the URL.

          EXAMPLE: example.org/badsite/

          This example will match a URL with a domain matching "example.org" as
          well as a URL that begins with "/badsite/". Entries are compared with
          the regular-expression engine and each entry uses significantly more
          memory than a domain entry (up to half a kilobyte), so be careful.

     c.   Expression lists

          An expression entry is a regular expression, matched against the URL.
          These can match a portion of the domain, URL, or both; since there is
          a possibility of matching a folder name to a domain, it is highly
          recommended that each line begin with a slash ("/") or some other
          character that can never match a domain name. Entries are compared
          with the regular-expression engine directly, so a bad expression can
          prevent the program from running. Be absolutely sure each entry is
          valid.
