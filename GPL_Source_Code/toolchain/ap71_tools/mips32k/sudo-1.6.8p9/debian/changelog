sudo (1.6.8p5-1ubuntu3) breezy; urgency=low

  * SECURITY UPDATE: Fix privilege escalation.
  * sudo.c, parse.yacc: safe_cmd contains the actually executed program which
    is normally taken from /etc/sudoers. However, if sudoers contains "ALL"
    entries that follow the matching entry, safe_cmd was overwritten with the
    path the user specified on the command line, which opens up the
    possibility of executing arbitrary commands by generating symlinks to
    them.
